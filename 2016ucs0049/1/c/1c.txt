On changing seed value, data values of variables changes as the order of execution of statement changes with seed value.

Due to no proper syncronization among processes race condition is observed.

For Example:
1. Seed Value: 1234543
	state = 0
2. Seed Value: 123
	state = 1
3. Seed Value: 4355
	state = 2
